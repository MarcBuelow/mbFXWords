The Japanese have the high punctuality in addition to the excellent technology and the good maintenance due to the fact that the Shinkansen network is separated from the local and freight network and almost completely fenced.

When it comes to punctuality, the Deutsche Bahn can cut a slice of Japanese railway operators. This applies to commuter trains as well as the fast Shinkansen. What is behind it.

German commuters can only dream of this: While trains in Germany have to justify themselves for delays and train cancellations, in distant Japan it is sometimes the other way round. There, a rail operator was recently induced to apologize to the passengers, because a suburban railway from Tokyo was not too late, but departed too early. Instead of 9:44, 44 minutes and 40 seconds, the Tsukuba Express drove smoothly at 9:44 am and 20 seconds. So in the right minute, but just 20 seconds too early.

We apologize deeply for the circumstances we have prepared for you, the customer, they said on the website of the railway company Metropolitan Intercity Railway Company. No one had complained. Nevertheless, it was unpleasant that the announcement for the departure of the train was made when he was already driving.
